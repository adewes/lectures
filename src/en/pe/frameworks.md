# Privacy Frameworks

Privacy engineering must always be oriented to the relevant legal framework.
Frameworks can help us to more easily capture such requirements and translate them into concrete technical requirements and measures.
Ideally, they represent the current state of the art and the current legal opinion and thus help us to reduce risks in the implementation of privacy engineering.
In this sense, frameworks are a link between the often abstract legal requirements and concrete technical measures that can be implemented in practice.

Choosing the right framework is not always easy. In general, one should first be clear about the context in which the framework is to be used.
For example, if you are looking for a framework that is suitable for the development of a software solution in Europe (e.g. in Germany), it makes sense to orientate yourself towards national frameworks.

In general, it should be noted that the use of a specific framework alone does not guarantee that the solution developed with it is automatically legally compliant. Frameworks have different overlaps with specific jurisdictions and international frameworks in particular are often not compliant.

## Considered frameworks

In the following sections, we will take a look at some frameworks that are of great practical importance. In particular, we will focus on the European region and especially on Germany. The following frameworks will be discussed:

### European & German Frameworks

* **Standard Data Protection Model (SDM)**
* **BSI IT basic protection**

### International frameworks

* **OECD Guidelines**
* **Generally Accepted Privacy Principles (GAPP)**
* **ISO 2700X series** (not specifically designed for privacy)

### US-centric frameworks

* **NIST Privacy Framework**
* **Federal Trade Commissions' (FTC) Fair Information Privacy Principles (FIPS)**
